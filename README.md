**# Spending-Calculator
C Project

**This project is about calculating you spendings, income, savings and Worth in a month.


*Insert your Income and Savings intially then start inserting the amount as you spend, save or earn in the month. 

**You can also see you Balance sheet if you want to know what amount you have saved, spent and what is your Worth at the moment.


The program will warn you if you spend over your income. 

This program is made to let people know if they have overspent, and let them know their worth. It will help people spend under their income and prevent them from going broke.
